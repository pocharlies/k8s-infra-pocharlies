# Keycloak SSO

This stack is the active SSO entry point for e-dani services.
`auth-next.e-dani.com` serves Keycloak and oauth2-proxy; `auth.e-dani.com`
redirects here for old bookmarks.

## Target shape

- `auth-next.e-dani.com` serves Keycloak.
- `auth-next.e-dani.com/oauth2/*` serves oauth2-proxy.
- Apps that do not support OIDC use the Traefik middlewares in the `keycloak`
  namespace:
  - `sso-forward-auth`
  - `sso-errors`
  - `sso-chain`
- Apps with native OIDC should use Keycloak directly.
- Traefik Edge must watch the `keycloak` namespace. This is configured in
  `/home/dibanez/k8s/k8s-infra-pocharlies/networking/traefik-edge/values.yaml`.

## Vault prerequisites

Create these Vault paths before adding this stack to the root
`kustomization.yaml`:

- `secret/keycloak-next/bootstrap`
  - `admin_username`
  - `admin_password`
- `secret/keycloak-next/postgres`
  - `username`
  - `password`
- `secret/keycloak-next/oauth2-proxy`
  - `client_id`
  - `client_secret`
  - `cookie_secret`

The oauth2-proxy client must be a confidential Keycloak client in the `edani`
realm. Use this callback:

```text
https://auth-next.e-dani.com/oauth2/callback
```

The Google identity provider callback in Keycloak will be:

```text
https://auth-next.e-dani.com/realms/edani/broker/google/endpoint
```

The live canary is configured with the Google OAuth client from the 1Password
item `Grafana Google OAuth - monitor.e-dani.com`. Add the callback above to
that Google Cloud OAuth client before expecting Gmail login to complete.

## Activation

This directory is referenced from the root kustomization. After the Vault
secrets and Google OAuth client exist:

1. Sync the Argo app.
2. Confirm the `keycloak` namespace is healthy.
3. Create the `edani` realm with groups:
   - `/edani-admins`
   - `/edani-operators`
4. Create a confidential client for oauth2-proxy and add a groups mapper.
5. Test a canary route with `keycloak/sso-chain`.

The included canary is:

```text
https://sso-canary.e-dani.com
```

Protected services should reference the `keycloak/sso-chain` Traefik middleware
or the centralized `https://auth-next.e-dani.com/oauth2/auth` endpoint.

oauth2-proxy deliberately uses public URLs for browser redirects and internal
Keycloak service URLs for token/JWKS/userinfo calls. This avoids pod egress to
Cloudflare and IPv6 resolution issues while preserving the public OIDC issuer.
